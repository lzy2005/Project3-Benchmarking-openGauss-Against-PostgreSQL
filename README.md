### Project3-Benchmarking-openGauss-Against-PostgreSQL

This project researches the differences between OpenGauss and PostgreSql-14.11 in efficiency and safety. It proposes some criteria and key metrics for evaluating the quality of databases and places emphasis on performance in complex data-intensive scenarios. It also gives test code for measuring differences between OpenGauss and PostgreSql-14.11 on these metrics. We executing these code on the elastic cloud server(ECS) and gained some conclusions about the features of OpenGauss. You can recurrence it as directed by [OpenGauss installation and deployment guide](OpenGauss_installation_and_deployment_guide.docx) and [report](report.pdf) in this project.

Here are some of our test results.

1. Efficiency comparison in insert operations:
